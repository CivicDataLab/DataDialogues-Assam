## Using data to understand the state of child-protection legislation in Assam

**Objective**

The core child protection legislation for children is enshrined in four main laws around Juvenile Justice, Child Marriage Prohibition, Protection of Children from Sexual Offences, and Child Labour.

The vast legal framework on child rights is unfortunately not backed with data that can inform law and policy change. It is quite difficult to access systematic information on what happens in courts, how special laws and provisions pan out in practice, to what extent have they been able to meet their purpose, etc. To better understand the gaps and challenges in the implementation of these laws, we need more granular datasets at various administrative levels that can be accessed by various stakeholders.

The objective of this discussion was to understand the current state of child protection data ecosystem in Assam and to discuss the steps that can be taken to create and curate FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) datasets.
