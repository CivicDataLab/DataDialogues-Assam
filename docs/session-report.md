### Objective

The core child protection legislation for children is enshrined in four
main laws around Juvenile Justice, Child Marriage Prohibition,
Protection of Children from Sexual Offences, and Child Labour.

Unfortunately, the vast legal framework on child rights is not backed
with data that can inform law and policy change. It is quite difficult
to access systematic information on what happens in courts, how special
laws and provisions pan out in practice, how they have been able to meet
their purpose, etc.

To better understand the gaps and challenges in the implementation of
these laws, we need more granular datasets at various administrative
levels that can be accessed by various stakeholders.

This report is a summary of the presentations, discussions, and
recommendations made by the participants, on the current state of the
child protection data ecosystem in Assam, during the **Data Dialogues**
event organised by CivicDataLab in collaboration with data.gov.in on
March 21st and 22nd, 2022.

### Discussion Summary

#### Key points by D. Savio Lakra on the ICPS dashboard, developed by the State Child Protection Society.

The SCPS is a statutory body present in all states to implement and
track ICPS. In Assam, we are developing a data driven mechanism to to
track the state of Child Protection Services. In the first phase of the
project, we have identified 33 indicators to be tracked. The data is
collected at a district level, although it is difficult for us to
collect data for new districts. Earlier, we did not have data per se but
just some pieces of information related to child protection issues.
Through this initiative, we would like to consolidate our data systems,
curate all important data points at one place and create better systems
for data collection by creating better data templates and providing data
entry capabilities to each districts.

On the dashboard front, we have the map of Assam on which the districts
are ranked as per their performance on respective indicators. This helps
us to follow up with districts that are not performing well on certain
parameters. The dashboard still lacks a lot of important indicators.
We’re planning to add more indicators in the next phase of the project.
There are a few reports that get generated on a periodic basis on the
state of child protection services. We would like to integrate these
reports as well within the same platform.

**Challenges faced in developing and maintaining the dashboard**

1.  No dedicated data analyst in the team - Data curation takes up a lot
    of manual effort and takes a lot of time. We need better systems in
    place and dedicated support for data curation and data analysis to
    be able to get the most out of this initiative.

2.  Availability of funds for further development - The first phase of
    the project was funded by UNICEF. We don’t have funds under
    dedicated budget heads within our budgets for us to sustain this
    initiative. We can’t divert funds from other budget heads to work on
    building the platform.

**Next steps for us**

We get enquired by various stakeholders who want access to data related
to child protection services. Currently, the platform has only a few
aggregated indicators. In the next phase of the project, we would like
to add more sources of information so that some of the data related
enquiries can be served from the platform itself. Also, we need increase
access to a more indicators so we can have a holistic understanding on
the state of child protection in Assam.

Till now we have had a good experience in building this dashboard.
Adding more indicators will make it more useful for a lot of
stakeholders. It was a proud moment for us when this dashboard was
highlighted as one of the best practices to be followed by child
protection societies throughout the country.

#### Key points shared by Miguel on the state of POCSO in Assam

**Challenges we face in our line of work**

1.  No data in the first place for us to analyse
2.  Special laws like the JJ Act and POCSO are handled by a lot of
    different institutions like the Police Department, CWC, District
    legal services authority, the courts, etc. Currently, there is no
    common systems or interface that connects all of them. This creates
    a lot of discrepancies in the data reported by all of them.

**Through our work, we ensure that the focus is on the procedure**

1.  We work with the Assam police to help them understand the procedures
    and the difference in procedures when it comes to special laws like
    the JJ Act, POCSO, etc.
2.  It is not easy for them to understand the procedures as they usually
    work within the CrPC/IPC framework and special acts come with their
    own sets of procedures.
3.  We believe that when they understand the procedures, their will be
    better implementation.
4.  To understand the implementation of these laws, we need to track if
    these procedures are been followed but we’re still unsure of how can
    we monitor these better.
5.  We can track whether or not the cases are closed in time, but how
    can we track if the IO has interviewed the child as per the
    guidelines listed within the POCSO Act.
6.  For the police, the metric is the total chargesheets filed but for
    us we would like to track how was the experience of the child who
    came in contact with the police.
7.  From our experice, we can say that most often that experience is
    negative.
8.  Hence, we believe that apart from the quantitative indicators, there
    should be focus on capturing certain qualitative indicators as well.
9.  A lot of times, children are called at police stations for recording
    of the statement under section 161 of the CrPC. Ideally, this should
    be done at the child’s residence or a place where they are
    comfortable. We have to tell the police officials to not call the
    children at the police station.
10. We usually look at justice delivery just in terms of numbers, as in
    the number of cases filed, but the quality of case diaries is often
    terrible.

**Other challenges linked with child protection services**

1.  No direct information about the fund availability within
    institutions. This creates a lot of hurdles when we have to get
    interim compensations or special relief for affected children.
2.  We don’t have any qualitative indicators on the tial of cases in
    courts.
3.  Funding crunch in the overall child protection umbrella throughout
    the country. The overall budget of child protection has decreased
    after Mission VATSALYA was launched.

**Next steps for us**

1.  We are partnering with UNICEF on developing a Sishu Mitra Program
    where we will help the police department setup an integrated centre
    of child rights. Here, the police HQ’s will provide technical
    assistance to the IO’s. Our focus here is to track the
    implementation of the POCSO act qualitatively (procedural
    implementation)

2.  In our cases, we have started to document experiences of children
    and we will work with the police to discuss these extensively.

**Our Recomendations**

1.  Investment on data is very important because that is what informs
    policy.
2.  There should be a common data management system at every stage of
    justice delivery and every stage should be connected to the other.  
3.  Tracking procedural implementation of laws is very important.

#### How to use data to track the implementation of child protection laws

Apoorv shared a presentation on how data from courts can be used to
track the implementation of laws. He talked about:

1.  The importance of tracking laws.
2.  Using data from sources like the NCRB and its limitations.
3.  POCSO related indicators in the NCRB - Crime in India dataset.
4.  How we can use data from courts to track laws.
5.  The challenges of accessing data from courts.
6.  List of indicators available on the e-Courts district courts portal.
7.  Using data from courts to track the POCSO Act in Assam, Delhi and
    Haryana. This was a joint collaboration between CivicDataLab and
    HAQ - Centre for Child Rights.
8.  Limitations of using data from courts.
9.  How CivicDataLab is planning to take this work ahead.
10. The JusticeHub platform for sharing datasets and resources related
    to Law and Justice.

### Concluding Remarks

**D Savio Lakra** - We need to collaborate with each other so that there
are better systems in place, also to get access to data collected from
field. Data is important to showcase if we’re working effectively or
not. A child should not be lost in the data ecosystem. All systems
should be connected at a case level. We should capture the entire
history of the child who gets involved with the system.

**Miguel Das** - We need to have conversation with people who can
effectuate change. We need to connect with leaders at the departments
who can take these decisions. We’re connected with a few officials who
are quite pro active. We can help facilitate these conversations. We
need to work at three levels - Social Welfare, Police and Judiciary.

### Way forward

1.  Setup conversations with the leadership at various institutions.
2.  Figure out and showcase how a data-led initiative will help them in
    better tracking and monitoring laws.
3.  Another important resource can be a report or a guidebook that
    details the process of creating a robust data management system that
    can keep the state level officials informed about the implementation
    of these acts.
